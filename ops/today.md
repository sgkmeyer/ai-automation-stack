## What Is Live and Healthy

**Production stack** (`automation` project on Oracle Free Tier VM):
- All 11 services up: caddy, db, redis, n8n, n8n-worker, n8n-webhook, n8n-task-runner, openclaw, chromium, portainer, toolbox
- **Stack versions (updated 2026-03-05):** n8n 2.9.2, Openclaw 2026.3.2, Portainer CE lts, Caddy 2-alpine, Postgres 16-alpine, Redis 7-alpine, Python 3.12-slim
- Public endpoints:
  - `https://n8n.satoic.com` → 200 (app auth)
  - `https://openclaw.satoic.com` → 200 (gateway token auth only, no Caddy basic_auth)
  - `https://portainer.satoic.com` → 401 pre-auth (expected)
- GitOps deploy active: push to `main` → SSH → `gitops-deploy.sh`
- Openclaw paired to Telegram (`@sg_tar_bot`), n8n API wired, Chromium CDP connected
- Openclaw hooks enabled: `http://openclaw:18789/hooks/` (internal only, dedicated token)
- n8n credentials configured: Gmail, Google Drive, Postgres, HubSpot, Google OAuth (drive.file)
- `public.leads` table live (unique on `domain`)
- JS-01 workflow **active** (id: `chwneHrHVCQON462`) — full pipeline wired by TAR
- `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` available in all n8n services (n8n, n8n-worker, n8n-webhook)

**VM layout:**
- Repo: `/home/ubuntu/ai-automation-stack` (cloned from GitHub)
- Runtime symlink: `/home/ubuntu/automation → /home/ubuntu/ai-automation-stack/automation`
- Stack path on VM: `/home/ubuntu/automation`

## Active Priorities (next session)

- [ ] Update `gitops-deploy.sh` to restart Caddy when Caddyfile changes (bind-mount not auto-detected)
- [ ] Research n8n v2 features — "Personal Agents" and "Workflow Agents" + how TARS could integrate
- [x] Fix `vm-safe.sh dr-backup` to use `tar -h` for symlink following (2026-03-05)
- [x] Fix `vm-safe.sh` usage text to include `n8n-task-runner` and `n8n-webhook` (2026-03-05)
- [ ] Build MCP bridge (Path A): Python MCP server on Mac → Openclaw API over Tailscale
- [ ] Set up shared handoff directory for Claude Code ↔ TAR async communication
- [ ] Test JS-01 end-to-end: `/lead <url>` → Openclaw → n8n → Postgres → HubSpot → Drive → Gmail
- [ ] Consider czlonkowski/n8n-mcp for better workflow authoring from Claude Code
- [x] Openclaw security hardening: gateway.auth.rateLimit + hooks.defaultSessionKey applied (2026-03-03)
- [x] Security audit baseline: 0 critical on both dev and prod (2026-03-03)
- [x] Dev Openclaw: added controlUi.allowedOrigins + fixed config perms (2026-03-03)
- [x] Caddy basic_auth removed for openclaw.satoic.com — gateway token auth only (2026-03-02)
- [x] Dev Openclaw Telegram disabled — prevents bot token conflict with production (2026-03-02)
- [x] Openclaw v2026.3.1 upgrade — dev-first validated, production deployed (2026-03-03)
- [x] Prod smoke test fixed: retry logic + startup delay + expected 200 for openclaw (2026-03-03)
- [x] Deploy scripts fixed to include `--build` flag for Dockerfile change detection
- [x] Dev lane cdp_net subnet collision fixed (dev: 172.31.0.0/24, prod: 172.30.0.0/24)
- [x] Full stack upgrade completed (2026-02-24): n8n v1→v2, Portainer lts, all patches pulled
- [x] Openclaw upgraded v2026.2.14 → v2026.2.23 → v2026.2.24 → v2026.2.26 → v2026.3.1; version pinned in Dockerfile
- [x] Openclaw post-upgrade recovery: fixed UID ownership, trustedProxies, device pairing, gateway token re-injection
- [x] Added post-deploy ownership check to `gitops-deploy.sh` (prevents UID drift)
- [x] Added Openclaw recovery runbook to `ops/runbooks.md`
- [x] OPENAI_API_KEY wired to Openclaw — TARS memory_search working

- [x] JS-01: TAR built and activated workflow (17 nodes, all credentials bound)
- [x] OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN propagated to all n8n services
- [x] CI SSH hardening: strict host key checking enabled; uses `VM_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` secret (2026-03-05)
- [x] n8n hardening: disabled `CODE_ENABLE_PROCESS_ENV_ACCESS` on n8n, worker, webhook (2026-03-05)
- [x] n8n image pinning: `n8nio/n8n:2.9.2` (2026-03-05)
- [x] Emergency rsync hardening: `sync-to-vm.sh` now does dry-run + confirmation before `--delete` (2026-03-05)
- [x] Dev CI deploy stabilized: sanitized `VM_TAILSCALE_HOST` + default fallback IP + `accept-new` host key policy (2026-03-05)
- [x] Dev GitOps lane fixed: force `--scale caddy=0` to avoid port 80/443 conflict with production Caddy (2026-03-05)
- [x] Hardening rollout validated end-to-end: dev deploy+smoke and prod deploy+smoke green (2026-03-05)
- [x] Openclaw upgraded v2026.3.1 → v2026.3.2; version pin updated in Dockerfile (2026-03-05)

## Backup & Recovery Model

### Current state (Tailscale live)

`./scripts/backup.sh` from the Mac works end-to-end:
SSH → VM backup → rsync artifacts to `.dr-backups/` locally → write manifest in `ops/dr-manifests/`.

**Always run from local Mac, never from the VM.** Scripts SSH outward to `satoic-production`.

**VM-local fallback** (if Mac-side scripts unavailable — e.g., SSH session directly on VM):
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu
sudo tar -h czf automation-full-$(date +%F-%H%M).tar.gz automation
docker run --rm \
  -v automation_db_storage:/data \
  -v /home/ubuntu:/backup \
  busybox tar czf /backup/automation-db-$(date +%F-%H%M).tar.gz /data
ls -lh /home/ubuntu/automation-full-*.tar.gz /home/ubuntu/automation-db-*.tar.gz | tail -n 4
```

## SSH Key Inventory

| Key | Purpose | Location |
|-----|---------|----------|
| `satoic_operator` | Personal Mac→VM (`ssh oracle`, `ssh satoic-production`) | `~/.ssh/satoic_operator` |
| `satoic_ci` | GitHub Actions CI/CD only | `~/.ssh/satoic_ci` + GitHub secret `VM_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` |
| `id_ed25519_github` | GitHub git operations | `~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github` |

**Next key rotation due: ~2026-03-20**
To rotate `satoic_operator`: generate new key → add to VM `authorized_keys` → remove old entry → update `~/.ssh/config`.
To rotate `satoic_ci`: generate new key → update GitHub secret → add to VM `authorized_keys` → remove old entry.

## Open Items / Known Risks

- **SSH key rotation due ~2026-03-20** — rotate `satoic_operator` and `satoic_ci` (see SSH Key Inventory above)
- **Dev/prod GitOps lanes** — `dev` branch live, auto-deploy green, smoke test green
- **Tailscale GitHub Action authkey deprecation warning** — migrate to OAuth client (`tailscale/github-action` warning active)
- **Dev stack running** — Openclaw v2026.3.2 validated on dev (2026-03-05)
- **`scripts/backup.sh` / `vm-safe.sh dr-backup` only work from local Mac** — do not suggest running these on the VM
- **Gateway token** — verified matching between `.env` and `openclaw/config.json`; propagated to all n8n services (2026-02-23)
- **Openclaw config schema (v2026.2.26+)** — `trustedProxies` and `controlUi` inside `gateway` section; `gateway.auth.rateLimit` uses `maxAttempts/windowMs/lockoutMs/exemptLoopback` (not `enabled/window/maxFailures`)
- **Openclaw security audit baseline** — 0 critical on both dev/prod (2026-03-03); see `ops/security-audit-2026-03-03.md`
- **Openclaw version pinned** — Dockerfile uses `ARG OPENCLAW_VERSION=2026.3.2`
- **Caddy bind-mount reload** — Caddyfile changes require explicit `docker compose restart caddy`; `docker compose up -d` does not detect bind-mount file changes
- **Openclaw device pairing** — new browser platforms (e.g., iPhone) require approval from an already-paired session; pending devices visible in `openclaw/devices/pending.json`
- **Openclaw basic_auth removed** — `openclaw.satoic.com` no longer uses Caddy basic_auth; gateway token (256-bit) is sole auth. Portainer still has basic_auth.
- **`openclaw onboard` overwrites config.json** — always backup before running; .bak may also be overwritten
- **Secrets rotated** — `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` rotated 2026-02-20; n8n MFA cleared and ready to re-enroll
- **Pre-GitOps VM backup** — `/home/ubuntu/automation.pre-gitops-2026-02-16-2147` still on VM; safe to remove
- **MCP bridge planned** — Path A (Python MCP server on Mac) recommended to reduce user relay between Claude Code and TAR
- **Agent roles defined** — TAR owns n8n workflow CRUD; Claude Code owns infra/docker-compose/Caddy/git
- **GitHub Actions SSH trust** — `VM_SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` secret must stay current when VM host keys rotate
- **Local `.env` missing `N8N_RUNNERS_AUTH_TOKEN`** — only on VM; should sync for parity
