# Session Log — 2026-02-17

## Scope
- Performed documentation currentness sweep and session-log hygiene updates.

## What Changed
### 1) Repository orientation updates
- Updated `README.md` to reflect current stack topology and references.
- Corrected the "latest session handoff" reference to this session file.
- Added explicit reference to the reusable session template.

### 2) Session log standardization
- Added `ops/SESSION-TEMPLATE.md` to standardize future handoff notes.
- Introduced a consistent structure for scope, changes, validation, risks, and next steps.

### 3) Chromium CDP config alignment
- Aligned `automation/docker-compose.chromium-native.yml` to use `--remote-debugging-port=9222`.
- This matches the runbook and expected Openclaw CDP target (`http://172.30.0.10:9222`).

## Validation Checks Passed
- Verified no stale `9223` references remain in docs/config.
- Verified README points to the newest session handoff file.
- Verified runbook and compose overlay now reference consistent CDP port/config.

## Known Risks / Notes
- `ops/SESSION-2026-02-16.md` was previously present but untracked; confirm expected git policy for session logs (tracked vs local-only).

## Next Session Plan
1. Confirm stack health on VM with 3-file compose `ps` and recent logs.
2. Build workflow #1 (Openclaw trigger -> n8n -> Postgres `leads` -> summary output).
3. Finalize JSON contract for Openclaw-generated n8n workflows.
