# Caddyfile.dev — Dev environment routing
#
# Tailscale-only access. No public TLS required.
# Tailscale is live: VM IP = 100.82.169.113, hostname = satoic-production
#
# Current dev access (no Caddy needed):
#   http://100.82.169.113:5679  →  dev n8n (direct host-port mapping)
#
# This file is a stub for future subdomain routing if needed.
# To activate: mount in a dev Caddy instance and access via :8080.
#
# upstream is n8n:5678 — container listens on 5678 internally;
# the host port 5679 mapping does not exist inside the Docker network.

:8080 {
